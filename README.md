# Friend Switch

**Friend Switch** is a Game Boy game about four school friends trying to escape detention. You must
switch between the friends and use their unique abilities to solve puzzles and avoid hall monitors
in the school.

The game is made in [GB Studio](https://www.gbstudio.dev/) and can be compiled into a ROM that can
be played on actual Game Boy hardware. The game can also be played in a web browser or on the
Analogue Pocket. See [this section](#how-to-play-the-game) for details on how to play the game.

The game was originally created for the
[Game Boy Showdown 2023 game jam](https://itch.io/jam/game-boy-showdown-2023).
